## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

## Deploy

We'll create two separate deployments which use the different build scripts (`build:production` and `build:preview`). 
Create two Vercel projects, connect both to the project's GitHub repo and set the Build Command 
under Settings > General > Build & Development Settings to npm run build:production for the static production site 
and to npm run build:preview for the SSR preview site. 
You should be able to do the same for Netlify, Cloudflare or similar providers.


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                           |
